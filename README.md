# Silicon Rhino

This is the *[Silicon Rhino](http://yeoman.io)* site

## I've spotted an issue!

While we wish we were perfect (and try our hardest to be), we are human and make mistakes. If you find an issue on our site, this is the place to fix it. Fork us, fix it and send a pull request.


## How do I make a contribution?

This site is made using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and the mighty fine [Yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io) generater for Jekyll sites, [generator-jekyllrb](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb).

To get started:

**1\.** Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SiliconRhino/siliconrhino.io.git
cd siliconrhino.io
```

**2\.** Install all modules and needed tools

```bash
npm install
npm install grunt -g
npm install grunt-cli -g
npm install bower -g
gem install bundler
gem install scss-lint
bundle install
bower install
```

You're now all set!


## I want to deploy my changes

Only a select few get to deploy changes to our site, sorry. But even if you aren't you might be interested to know how we do it. 

Since we used generator-jekyllrb to create our site, check out their instructions in the  [usage section in the generator's README](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb/blob/a6b7f84df446378195b9b638509c5d7890fa130d/README.md#grunt-workflow). It's really quite easy to do.
