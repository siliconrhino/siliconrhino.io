    <h1>FAQs</h1>

    <h2>What is <span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span>?</h2>

    <p><span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span> is an app to make meeting friends quick and easy. Plan those snap events with a few touches on the screen. Or plan further ahead with the calendar.</p>

    <h2>What if I don’t drink?</h2>

    <p>Chances are, if you are reading this and comprehend the text, you do drink.  <span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span> isn’t just for meeting up over an alcoholic beverage but for any social event including the mid-morning coffee, afternoon tea, post-gym smoothie, late night soiree in your flat, the Sunday bbq… or could even be for that gallon of soft drink when you head to see the next Marvel movie at the cinema.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>Once you’ve downloaded the app, connect with Facebook and you’re away! Your friends need to download <span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span> too for you to be able to arrange an event with them.  We’re working on phone contacts, LinkedIn and Twitter integration too, so you’ll soon be able to go for drinks with everyone in your social network.</p>

    <h2>I’ve downloaded the app, connected to Facebook, added friends (who also have <span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span> installed on their phones) and still can’t get it to work. Help!</h2>

    <p>Okay, there’s obviously something very wrong.  We’ve made <span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span> to be as simple and easy to use as possible. If you’re not getting it to work, we’d love to hear from you and get the problem resolved. Get in touch via <span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span>@siliconrhino.io</p>

    <h2>Which devices do you work on?</h2>

    <p>The first release will be on Android, followed quickly on iOS - for all of our Apple fans out there.</p>

    <h2>I am still using my Blackberry/Nokia - how can I start using <span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span>?</h2>

    <p>Go down to your local phone shop and purchase a better smartphone!</p>

    <h2>What does it cost?</h2>

    <p><span class="siliconrhino-brand">drinks</span> is completely* free  (*drinks not included)</p>

    <h2>What if I don’t have a Facebook account?</h2>

    <p>We’re working on other ways to connect you with your friends.  Hang in there and keep checking back on the site.  Or even better yet, sign up to our newsletter so we can keep you posted (see the bottom of the page).</p>
