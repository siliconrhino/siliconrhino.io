  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p class="lead">It all started with our love for all things coding. After meeting at a previous job, we have been developing our careers for the last 5 years. We have been entrepreneurs, CTO's and product leaders. We have launched Blogging platforms, worked with some of the biggest news websites in the UK, and developed business strategies to success...<p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all this experience, we realised our strength lies between an idea and the product launch. We are here to do that for you...</p>

    <h2>Roger Planes</h2>

    <p>Originally from Barcelona, Roger moved to London in 2010 as soon as he graduated in Computer Science at the UAB. From junior developer to team leader in six months, he soon decided entrepreneurship was his path, founding and designing <a href="http://glipho.com/">Glipho</a> in 2012. </p>
    <p>Balancing business and development, he has been a consultant helping companies develop their business during last year, from new product launch to social media strategies.</p>
    <p>Roger has been a Nintendo fan since he discovered Mario at 5 years old. Forget about beer, it's all about Red Wine (Rioja) and cooking food.</p>

    <h2>Phil Hardy</h2>
    <p>Phil grew up with technology and had an interest from an early age. This led him to a degree in Computing, which he graduated from with first class honours.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">While the others were launching ventures, Phil focused on architecting and developing a highly available automated video production system. Not for the faint of heart. He then worked on his project management qualities by leading the development of a content marketing focused CMS.</p>
    <p>Forget about the cycling, Phil is all about Beers, Gaming and BBQ (and we love him for that).</p>
