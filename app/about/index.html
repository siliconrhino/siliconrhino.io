        Originally from Barcelona, Roger moved to London in 2010 equipped with a
        degree in Computer Science from the UAB. He quickly found his passion in
        entrepreneurism. With a vision to re-invent the blogging experience
        Roger lived between San Francisco and London building and designing his
        venture, Glipho.

        His experience as a founder sparked his passion for helping others

        Roger has been a Nintendo fan since he discovered Mario at 5 years old.
        Forget about beer, it's all about Red Wine (Rioja) and cooking food.

        Phil grew up with technology and had an interest from an early age. This

        While the others were launching ventures, Phil focused on architecting

Already at the age of 9 he started to do some small technical inventions and fixing electronic devices. Later on he jumped into the IT industry, from building and configuring computers and networks to software development, because he said to himself : "I want to create/build software !".
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, Jeff has been working as fullstack Software Engineer in several companies, including startups, within the last 10 years.

        Jeff loves to learn new technologies and share knowledge with others, and he even taught his 13 years old son who is now an applications developer (from age of 12). He likes travelling and driving powerful cars, and his favourite sports program is WWE (wrestling).
