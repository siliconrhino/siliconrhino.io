        Originally from Barcelona, Roger moved to London in 2010 equipped with a
        degree in Computer Science from the UAB. He quickly found his passion in
        entrepreneurism. With a vision to re-invent the blogging experience
        Roger lived between San Francisco and London building and designing his
        venture, Glipho.
      </p>
      <p>
        His experience as a founder sparked his passion for helping others
        balancing business and product development.

      <p>
        Roger has been a Nintendo fan since he discovered Mario at 5 years old.
        Forget about beer, it's all about Red Wine (Rioja) and cooking food.

        Phil grew up with technology and had an interest from an early age. This
        led him to a degree in Computing, which he graduated from with first
        class honours.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        While the others were launching ventures, Phil focused on architecting
        and developing a highly available automated video production system. Not
        for the faint of heart. He then worked on his project management
        qualities by leading the development of a content marketing focused CMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phil is all about Beers (IPA all the way), gaming, and he is the
        official silicon rhino BBQ host (and we love him for that).
