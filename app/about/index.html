  <h3>We are on a journey...</h3>
  <p class="lead">It all started with our love of code. After meeting at a previous job, we have been developing our careers for the last 5 years. We've been entrepreneurs, CTO's and product leaders. We have launched Blogging platforms, worked with some of the biggest news websites in the UK, and developed many successful business strategies.</p>
  <p class="lead" dir="ltr">Our strength is your weakness. We're here to get you from idea to launch.</p>

    <img class="profile blue-border" src="/img/roger.jpg" alt="Roger Planes" title="Roger Planes"></div>

    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-pull-6 profile-description"><p>Originally from Barcelona, Roger moved to London in 2010 equipped with a degree in Computer Science from the UAB. He quickly found his passion in entrepreneurism. With a vision to re-invent the blogging experience Roger lived between San Francisco and London building and designing his venture, Glipho.</p>
    <p>His experience as a founder sparked his passion for helping others balancing business and product development.</p>
    <p>Roger has been a Nintendo fan since he discovered Mario at 5 years old. Forget about beer, it's all about Red Wine (Rioja) and cooking food.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-6 profile-description"><p>Phil grew up with technology and had an interest from an early age. This led him to a degree in Computing, which he graduated from with first class honours.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">While the others were launching ventures, Phil focused on architecting and developing a highly available automated video production system. Not for the faint of heart. He then worked on his project management qualities by leading the development of a content marketing focused CMS.</p>
    <p>Phil is all about Beers (IPA all the way), gaming, and he is the official silicon rhino BBQ host (and we love him for that).</p>

    <p>From the Great Southern Land, Mark has been involved with the London startup scene since 2012 helping entrepreneurs through KPMG's start-up team.</p>
    <p>Finally succumbing to getting his hands dirty, Mark brings his expertise in all things startup...</p>
    <p>As an all rounder, Mark enjoys beer & wine but is truly the coffee snob in the team, which makes him the perfect drinking buddy. From cricket to anime, Mark's wide range of interests is vast, though still hasn't decided on a football team to support.</p>
