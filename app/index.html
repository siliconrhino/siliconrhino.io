      <blockquote class="left-paragraph long">As a founder with a non-technical background, trying to work out what exactly it was that I needed was taking a very long time! It was after months of searching that I found Silicon Rhino.<br><br>Phil and Roger were able to understand what I needed and were able to outline a number of different options to help me move on from the MVP stage.<br><br>It was great to be able to reach out to the team and have highly technical issues outlined in terms that a non-technical person can understand!<br><br>The range of their knowledge is pretty amazing as well - if you want it done then the chances are they will know how to do it! It was great fun working with the team and I hope to work with them in the future when the time comes for us to improve our systems once again!</blockquote>

In the depths of the project, our morale, would be boosted with welcome encouragement as we worked together to make our business the best it could be.<br><br>If not for their technical prowess, or their savvy business acumen, we recommend you hire them because they are nice friendly people to work with that make the audacious challenge of a new venture a successful and fun one.</blockquote>
