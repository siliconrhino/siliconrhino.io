Since my last and first blog post, we have launched our own brand new website. What a great and weird feeling. This is my first real project, which is not just another prototype, but an actual product, which is live and fully functional. Months of hard work and frustration have come to an end, until next time of course. It’s a relief and a bit sad as well, at one hand you’re just happy to not have to look at that particular design anymore, in the end you just want to change it all as you are so tired of looking at it and I felt that maybe the design wasn’t sharp enough or consistent enough and was just hoping that the users would understand it and hopefully like it. And so far the feedback has been really good better than I dared to hope for. People actually like it, wow. But after the rush of good feedback and celebration the sadness occurs. What now? I feel a bit lost. But hopefully I get these feeling after all ended products - I think it just means that you really care about your projects and what you are doing.

Enough about me being so melodramatic on post launch feelings. Now to some coding frustrations.

I am now almost halfway into my internship, and for the above mentioned project I have been working mostly with design and visual representation, my toolboxes has therefore primarily been Adobe Illustrator and my IDE for CSS, and bit of JavaScript - we are still working very hard on becoming friends or just acquaintances.

CSS - Cruel Structureless Styling
What I have learned lately is that CSS does definitely not stand for “Clear and Simple (way to) Style” your HTML document. CSS is all but simple. Like HTML and JavaScript have rules and structure, CSS is much more up to you. That sounds awesome, right? You make the rules kinda, but it actually makes it a lot more overwhelming, especially when you are new to coding - you just want simplicity and some sort of structure. 

It’s not completely true that there’s no structure in CSS, I am over exaggerating now, but it’s so easy to get lost in what looked like a nice structure to begin with. For bigger projects, I think in the future it would be better to divide my CSS into several files, to maintain the overview, and SASS will be very helpful as well.

SASS - So Awesome Styling Structure

Is just great, makes your life so much easier, when you are working on bigger projects. In school we had a so called masterclass, which introduced you to SASS, and I remember I was thinking, it was a bit overkill to use this when you a making a simple portfolio. But of course it makes great sense - as your portfolio hopefully will evolve and expand and the you can easily reuse your code.

You know it’s like your friends just become more and more beautiful the more and better you get to know them. That’s how I feel about coding in general.

While CSS and I are making good friends. JavaScript and I are another subject, as I have mentioned before. But we will be working on our friendship in the next half of my internship. JavaScript is like a pair of Alexander Wang boots, you know you don’t really need them to walk, but they just making walking around the city so much cooler.
