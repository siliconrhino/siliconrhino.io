We sat down the other day (actually slacked) to decide when we would celebrate Ryan’s (our mascot) first birthday. Should it be when we first talked about it? Or the day we started working on the first project? Maybe when we finally agreed to call ourselves silicon rhino? We ended up settling for the not-so romantic ‘Company Incorporation Date’, March 27th.

A lot of things have happened in the last 12 months, starting with the ‘silicon rhino man down’ situation. What started as a journey of 3 became a duo when our co-founder, James, realised this wasn’t the path for him, although we parted ways amicably and he will always be part of our family.

**July 1st** is our most significant date, the day we actually started dedicating ourselves full-time to silicon rhino. Thanks to an unexpected turn of events,  we had the choice to either commit to this properly or scrap the idea… and although it wasn’t a difficult decision it was nonetheless a scary jump. It hasn’t always been easy, but it has always been worth it.

It’s true we haven’t blogged much (at all) to explain what we’ve been up to. (we intend to change that), but that’s because it’s been so much fun working with really inspiring people on amazing products. We’ve developed in 9 different languages across 12 different application frameworks, learned different technologies monthly, and all that while working from countless different places.

We’ve met great entrepreneurs with even greater visions, and we are proud to have helped them achieve their goals through technology. Each one of them has taught us something, and hopefully we’ll be able to pass all this knowledge to all the founders we still have to work with. Last but not least are the people who decided to carry on working with us in this adventure, and we’ve embarked on some great projects together this last year.

###Some of the projects we've worked on

We started silicon rhino because we felt founders without technical skills deserved a good team which cared about their projects as their own, and we feel we have achieved that. We will make sure this continues to be our number 1  focus in the future.

###So, what’s next for the rhinos?

The team is growing soon and we couldn’t be more excited. We are lucky to have the opportunity to work with really talented people, and we can’t wait to see what we can achieve together. We hope to find a place to call our own soon too, but always keeping our mantra “you can work from anywhere at anytime”.


We have also been working on our very first internal project, codename ‘Drinks’. It’s going slowly but surely, and we hope to have a beta for you as soon as possible!

To all of you who have helped and supported us, we wouldn’t have made it here if it wasn’t for you. Thank you!

Here’s to the next 12 months.

Roger & Phil
